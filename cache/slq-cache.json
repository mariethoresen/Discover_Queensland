Her family moved to the Murchison goldfields in Western Australia in 1896. Educated in Dongara and Perth, she was a gifted musician and had her own band 'The Entertainers'. Her family's interest in the Labor movement greatly influenced May and she became the first Labor woman parlimentarian, elected as the representative for the Forrest riding. She saw herself primarily as the representative of families' interests in the small forest settlements of her electorate. She spoke effectively on the issues such as the lack of medical care, decent housing and schooling and dangerous work. She was, at various times, president of Perth Labour women; president then secretary of the Labor Women's Central Executive; president of the Labor Women's Interstate Executive and secretary to the Parlimentary Labor Party. In 1938, at her instigation, a royal commission was set up looking into sanitation, slum clearance and health and housing regulations in Perth. She passed away in 1939.

He joined the Queensland Railways Department as a porter in 1903 and was later a shunter. Hanlon helped to establish the Queensland Railway Union and was a member and vice-president of its management-committee. In 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and joined the 9th Battalion in Egypt. He served on the Western Front and rose to the rank of sergeant. After being discharged in 1919 he set up a grocery business with his brother Patrick. Hanlon later entered politics and won the seat of Ithaca for the Labor Party in 1926. In Forgan Smith's government Hanlon was home secretary from June 1932 to December 1935 when he became secretary for health and home affairs. In 1944 he became treasurer and deputy to the premier F.A. Cooper. From 7 March 1946 until his death in office on 15 January 1952, Hanlon was premier of Queensland.

(Description supplied with photograph) The suburb of Dutton Park was originally known as Bloggo, which became corrupted to Boggo and thus gave the name to Boggo Road (now known as Annerley Road). The area was eventually renamed Dutton Park after Charles Boydell Dutton who was the Queensland Minister for Lands from 1883 to 1887. Originally the district was not popular with settlers because of early plans for the construction of the South Brisbane Cemetery and gaol. However the area eventually found favour due to its proximity to the city and the development of public transport. The South Coast Railway was built through the district and a station was opened at Dutton Park in 1884. Land was initially bought for farming, however residential development soon followed after the introduction of the tramline in 1908.
